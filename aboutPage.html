    <p class="text-about text-style" style="color: floralwhite">Like many others, I discovered my passion for technology when I was quite young. At high school I’ve developed a simple social network within a team of 3 people and during the first year of University I’ve led a group of 7 people throughout the early stage of a tech startup, eventually realising that I lacked the ability to ideate a deeply innovative product which could actually help the mankind in a meaningful way. <br>This is the reason why I put aside for a while the idea of founding a company and decided to focus on my knowledge, skills, and general improvement. Doing so, I fell in love with academia, mathematics,  research, and could spend a significant amount of time actively nurturing my interests in Cognitive Neuroscience and AI/ML. <br>Winning a 2-month long competition, I could join NECSTLab, a research Laboratory of Politecnico di Milano, where I have contributed to a project and eventually presented it at UC Berkeley and Facebook HQ (Menlo Park, CA). Meanwhile, I’ve completed the second year of the BSc with a GPA of 29.55/30 and started realising how the AI systems currently available are only a faint image of the possible ones and that I would love to contribute to such progress. As a consequence, I have joined AIRLab (AI and Robotics Lab), another research lab of PoliMi, where I am conducting theoretical research in Reinforcement Learning supervised by prof. Marcello Restelli. </p>
